Hi! I'm Qihao Lin, currently an M.S. student at Carnegie Mellon University working on assistive robotics. My research interests lie in robot perception and manipulation, machine learning and human–robot interaction. I am a member of the Robotic Caregiving and Human Interaction (RCHI) Lab, where I am advised by Dr. Zackory Erickson.

I received my BS degree in Aerospace Engineering at Sun Yat-sen University. During my undergraduate reaserch, I was in Robotics and Intelligent Sensing Lab advised by Dr. Chongkun Xia. As an undergraduate researcher, I worked on several projects related to robotic perception and manipulation, including deformable and transparent object sensing and manipulation.

In addition to academic research, I gained industry experience as a machine learning engineer intern at Shenzhen Haoya IoT Co., Ltd., where I worked on algorithm development for sign language translation systems. My work involved developing on device sign language translation AI models, as well as processing and analyzing sign language data. It further strengthened my interest in developing assistive robotic systems that are both technically robust and practically meaningful.

Besides doing reaserch, I also have interest in music and sports. I used to be a member of a band called Decide it tommorow, as singer and guitarist. Also I like to do basketball, jogging and workout. Fell free to contact me if there's anything you feel interesting!
